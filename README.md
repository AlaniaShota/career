# Career

Career - is a web application for finding jobs and managing applications. It is built with React, TypeScript, and Vite, and uses Zustand for state management and Tailwind CSS for responsive design. The app has job filters, dynamic job cards, and smooth animations with Framer Motion.

## Installation

Install dependencies:

```bash
  npm install
```
run the project:
```bash
  npm run dev
```
and you are all set!

## Technical decisions

~ Vite + TypeScript – used Vite because it builds the project fast and works well with TypeScript. It is easy to set up and helps write safer code.

~ React + Tailwind CSS – React is used to create the user interface and Tailwind CSS for styling. The design is simple, clean, and works on all devices.

~ Zustand – used to manage the app state. It makes the code easier to read and maintain.

~ Future improvements:

I plan to add smooth animations using Framer Motion to make the app more interactive.

I want to save user actions or filters so the user can return to previous searches.

I will improve the code by typing all components fully. This will reduce bugs and make the project easier to work on in the future.
